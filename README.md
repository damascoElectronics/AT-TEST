## Library Management System

The following repocitorty is a C++ application for managing a library collection. This system allows users to add, search, borrow, return, and remove books while persisting data between sessions.

## Features

- Add books to the library with title, author, year, and availability status
- Search for books by ID, title, or author
- Borrow and return books (update availability status)
- Display all books in the library
- Remove books from the library
- Data persistence using JSON file storage

## Dependencies

- C++17 standard library
- nlohmann/json (included as a header-only library)

## Building and Running

### Using the Automated Script

The easiest way to build and run the application is with the provided shell script:

```bash
# Make the script executable if needed
chmod +x run.sh

# Build and run the application
./run.sh

# To only run the application (if already built)
./run.sh run
```

The script will:
1. Detect your operating system
2. Check for required build tools (make, g++)
3. Download the necessary JSON library if not already present
4. Compile the project
5. Offer to run the application

### Manual Building

If you prefer to build the project manually:

```bash
# Create necessary directories
mkdir -p bin obj data deps/include/nlohmann

# Download JSON library if needed
curl -o deps/include/nlohmann/json.hpp https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nlohmann/json/develop/single_include/nlohmann/json.hpp

# Build the project
make

# Run the application
./bin/library_management_system
```

## Usage

Upon starting the application, you'll be presented with a menu:

```
Library Management System
-------------------------
1. Add a new book
2. Search for a book
3. Borrow a book
4. Return a book
5. Display all books
6. Remove a book
0. Exit
Enter your choice:
```

Navigate the menu by entering the number corresponding to your desired action.

## Data Storage

The application stores library data in JSON format at `data/books.json`. This file is created automatically if it doesn't exist and is updated whenever changes are made to the library collection.

## Third-Party Libraries

### nlohmann/json

This project uses the JSON for Modern C++ library by Niels Lohmann.
